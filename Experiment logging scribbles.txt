Focus should be instantaneous - we can gather some data going up to 150C at higher power.


1st long run:
1. 105 A rms to start off with - this is for a long period, without any airflow or cooling, alongside being effectively a heater. But the heater model can be considered accurate because of some losses anyways. However this is when running at lower duty.

2. To get accurate model, we want full power, 2 runs - then see what happens in the first 2 minutes



2nd short run:

Approx 5-600 Watts in, 115 A rms to start off - 37% Throttle duty.


3rd short run:
11.30 start - 100% throttle duty. Sent full beans -->

(Approx 120 Arms phase to phase current) --> Heated up to 175C


4th short run:

12.56 start time - approx. 300-400 Watts. Temperature reached 170 C.

5th short run

14.31 start time - full throttle, max power. Complete run... - very fast warm up to 170 Deg


6th run:

Phase balance test and a little more than 300W

Currents strange:

102to5-1-blue, 96-2-brown, 116-3-grey --> At 85

99-1-blue, 102-2-brown, 118-3-grey --> At 140

Had not realised - fan breeze was on






7th run:

Phase balance test and a little more than 300W

Currents strange:

-blue, -brown, -grey --> At 40

-blue, -brown, -grey --> At 85

-blue, -brown, -grey --> At 120

-blue, -brown, -grey --> At 160
