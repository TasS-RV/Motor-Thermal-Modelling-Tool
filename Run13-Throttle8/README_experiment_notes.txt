Note that in Runs 11-14 - one of the thermocouples have been attached to the stator body instead, whcih is also a good IR emitter therefore good at dissipating heat given it is black.

The label for this in the DDAQ_run[number].csv files is normally Housing (°C), however has been relabelled to Stator Body (°C). This is purel;y for the purpose of parsing the data, due
to how the code functions as of 11/22/25 @ 15.55.
